# CSV-Repair

This repository contains python code (in a jupyter notebook) and a sample Covid-19 related CSV file from Carbon Health. 

The code takes this well formatted and normalized CSV file and introduces a series of errors common in research oriented datasets. The resulting is intended for a workshop on how to transform difficult csv and excel files into a format that is easier for researchers to use.
